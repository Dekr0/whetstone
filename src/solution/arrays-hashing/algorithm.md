- dynamic arrays
- hash usage & hash implementation
- prefix sums
- hashing algorithm / encoding
    - prime number encoding
        - multiplication and then mod a magic number if having 
        a "sequential" prime number
        - addition with a selective prime number (magic ?)
- boyer-moore majority vote algorithm
- monotonic stack
- memory saving strategy
    - usually comes in the form of using variables as state
    - traverse left and right at the same
    - two pointers
- bounded memory usage
    - sometime memory is not necessary equal to the size of the input due to 
    specific constraint, e.g.
        - monotic stack and next greater element
- bounded inner loop
    - sometime inner loop not necessary be O(N), e.g.
        - 26 english letter
        - monotic stack and next greater element
